1. Create a default routing app.get('/') to index.ejs
2. On the client side prompt the user to enter their name and 
    save it to a variable.
3. On the server side add io.on connection to and emit a new user event
    which will set the name of the user in the client side.
4. At the same time in the first connection of a user, the server will start
    an emit event that will start the guessing game.
    -- The emit should contain the word to be guessed that calls a function
        to randomize a word.
5. At this point, the user should see the word to be guessed and the number of
    players.
6. In the client side we will have an event player_guessed to be emitted every-
    time a user entered their word in the textbox.
    -- In the server side, the socket.on('player_guessed) will check if the 
    entered word is correct.
    --- if correct : returns the user won : else do nothing
